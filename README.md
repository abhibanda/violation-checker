 Implementing social distancing policies in public areas is challenging due to COVID-19, traffic signals, necessitating the development of automated surveillance systems using Python, Deep Learning models, and image processing libraries.
The project's goal is to provide a proactive, flexible, and scalable method of reducing the spread of infectious diseases in public areas.This system uses technology and automated monitoring to minimize the risk of disease transmission, encourage responsible behavior among those using shared areas, and reinforce public health safety measures.
